- save Wrds dfs
- create some tools for analysis of matrices (how many of them are above certain value, look at trends?)
- what if there is no persistence? Is there a persistence over months, larger window size?
	- look for specific case which is most persistent

- Other ideas: systematic S&P market shorting strategy, based on graph components
	- edges might not necessarily be lead lag correlations
	- attempt no-lag correlations in closes
	- Finite state automata and Markov chains
